By and large it propelsbetween the most important activities i.e, acquisition and retention of audience in any business.\\nOver the years, there were quite some advancements digitally in the Ô¨Åeld of marketing and sales but don'tyou worry, we've got it all covered up for you in this course. All the concepts have been thoroughly touchedupon and simpliÔ¨Åed as you move ahead.\\nNow to get into the insights of digital marketing and sales automation, we ought to know what is marketingand sales in its entirety!\\nAs you read through, you will Ô¨Ånd the journey of automation systems running from fundamentals to itsadvanced levels.\\nDo you ever wonder how a business or a brand could rightly target who might potentially be their customerfor their product or service? If you haven't yet guessed, it's the Marketing Automation Platforms that enablethe businesses and brands to reach to their prospects effectively. These systems shortlist the number ofpotential buyers and assist the marketers to streamline their strategies in a coherent manner.\\nMarketing automation industry is a growing and booming industry that can be a real game-changer for smallto giant businesses.\\nConventionally speaking, sales and marketing are seen as separate functions. Where on one hand, marketingaims to generate awareness about the company to its audience and, sales on the other hand aim to turnsthat into a potential customer. However, these functions are executed for a common goal which is eithercustomer acquisition or retention.\\nTake a moment and think of a system which accomodates both functions in a single platform! Let us crack itfor you...It'll be the ultimate solution for any company that vigorously works on building a competentcustomer relationship with their leads/prospects.\\nMarketing and sales automation refers to a productive interplay between the respective departments. Theyprovide insight into prospect and customer behaviour which in turn helps the businesses reach growth at afaster and a quicker pace. What does growth mean here? It simply translates to the conversion of prospectsinto potential customers.\\nThere is a teeny weeny cycle involved where, marketing is the Ô¨Årst guy to play the cards, sales jumps in rightafter and if there is still no conversion, then marketing gets reactivated. This cycle repeats until the desiredresults are met. Now, all you have to do is imagine both these functions being automated by an intelligence.Boom! That's the ultimate solution, is it not?\\nWe hope, the introduction helped you capture the essence of automation in marketing and sales. You willexplore more as you move ahead.

Everything in real-time. 24/7.

The architecture is designed by building relationshipsbetween data parameters into a structure which behaves like a Turing tape. Such a structure can solve anybusiness-related problem arising from data or data automation.\\nBase Architecture with tagging pre-sets (Absolute DataTagging)\\nIt is important to build a data aware model where captured data is directly stored against the tag. For newdata, it is important to build the relationship as it‚Äôs being stored. With this, each time data is collected, it canstore against the pre-existing tag. If done for each customer/user, it would create a holistic view across allchannels and sources. If data is sequenced using time-series, it can create complete customer journeyswithout gaps. If objective states are set, it can create tags based on stages of the customer lifecycle. Withthis we achieve a holistic view of a single customer without any gaps. This makes way for accurate analysis.\\nBehavior Patterns and Real-time scoring\\nNow that we have the customer journey of a single customer, successful and unsuccessful patterns can beidentiÔ¨Åed. Assigning meaningful scores to each event can help in creating auto segmentation based onbehavioral parameters which broadly comprises customer. interactions, responses, transactions and usersentiments.\\nAssociation Rules and Real-time scoring\\nThe behavioral data provides insights that help in delivering recommendations based on past purchases,wish lists or by patterns derived from users with similar proÔ¨Åles. We can use real-time recommendationmodels to arrive at a product list by scores based on association parameters.\\nReal-time pattern matching or state identiÔ¨Åers for triggeractivation\\nUsing a lifecycle grid analysis, you can create states across the customer lifecycle and use the behavior orrecommendation scores to trigger communication. A rule library for each state or segment type will allowthe machine to trigger communications if a particular rule is satisÔ¨Åed.\\nResponse recording and the insight churn loop\\nAfter the communication is triggered, the system needs to loop back the responses of the customer withrespect to the communication and store data against the pre-existing tag. This ensures that the newresponses are added to the existing insights and the new derivative is rendered for next action. Storingagainst the tag will help maintain single customer data at all times.\\nGetting Started\\nIntroduction\\nCore Concepts\\nMy Account\\nProÔ¨Åle\\nPreferences\\nManage Users\\nTracking Script\\nDashboard\\nOverview\\nRealtime\\nCampaign Calendar\\nCampaign Overview\\nContacts\\nManage Contacts\\nManage Group\\nContact Import\\nContact Validation\\nSettings\\nWeb Analytics\\nSessions\\nVisitor\\nGeography\\nBehaviour\\nTechnology\\nSite Search\\nTraÔ¨Éc Sources\\nConversions\\nContent Analysis\\nWeb Engagement\\nForms & Banners\\nBrowser NotiÔ¨Åcations\\nLanding Page\\nMobile Analytics\\nSessions\\nVisitors\\nGeography\\nBehaviour\\nTechnology\\nContent Analysis\\nMobile NotiÔ¨Åcations\\nPush Campaign\\nIn-App Campaign\\nSettings\\nEmail\\nDashboard\\nEmail Campaigns\\nEmail Templates\\nReports\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\sample-data.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Terms of Use | Privacy Policy¬© 2025 Decisive Analytical Systems Pvt Ltd.\\nGetting Started\\nIntroduction\\nCore Concepts\\nMy Account\\nProÔ¨Åle\\nPreferences\\nManage Users\\nTracking Script\\nDashboard\\nOverview\\nRealtime\\nCampaign Calendar\\nCampaign Overview\\nContacts\\nManage Contacts\\nManage Group\\nContact Import\\nContact Validation\\nSettings\\nWeb Analytics\\nSessions\\nVisitor\\nGeography\\nBehaviour\\nTechnology\\nSite Search\\nTraÔ¨Éc Sources\\nConversions\\nContent Analysis\\nWeb Engagement\\nForms & Banners\\nBrowser NotiÔ¨Åcations\\nLanding Page\\nMobile Analytics\\nSessions\\nVisitors\\nGeography\\nBehaviour\\nTechnology\\nContent Analysis\\nMobile NotiÔ¨Åcations\\nPush Campaign\\nIn-App Campaign\\nSettings\\nEmail\\nDashboard\\nEmail Campaigns\\nEmail Templates\\nReports\\nNext ‚Üí\\nHomeBlogContact')]\n"
